/*
 * A kitty graphics protocol implementation that renders images as
 * absolutely-positioned DOM canvases in an overlay above xterm.js, instead of
 * baking them into the cell buffer the way @xterm/addon-image does. That is the
 * whole reason this exists: a placement in the cell buffer cannot be moved, and
 * moving placements is what an application that redraws, scrolls or repositions
 * an image needs.
 *
 *   - Update a placement in place (re-emit a=p with the same i,p and the canvas
 *     moves, rather than a second canvas stacking on the first).
 *   - Delete one placement (d=p,i=N,p=M) without discarding the image bytes, so
 *     a later re-place still works.
 *   - Source-region clipping (x,y,w,h) through drawImage arguments.
 *   - Track scroll, resize and font change, and reposition everything live.
 *
 * Placements are anchored to a buffer row through an xterm marker, so they
 * scroll with their text, survive scrollback trimming and are dropped when the
 * row they belong to falls out of history. After a placement the cursor is
 * moved past the image as the protocol requires, so the cells it covers are
 * genuinely consumed in the buffer rather than only painted over.
 *
 * Supported subset:
 *
 *   Actions:  a=t, a=T, a=p, a=d, a=q
 *   Medium:   t=d (direct base64) only
 *   Formats:  f=24 (RGB), f=32 (RGBA), f=100 (PNG)
 *   Compress: o=z (zlib through DecompressionStream)
 *   Chunks:   m=0, m=1, accumulated per image id until m=0
 *   Keys:     i, I, p, s, v, c, r, x, y, w, h, X, Y, z, C, U, q
 *   Delete:   d=a|A (all), d=i|I (by image id), d=n|N (by image number),
 *             d=p|P (by placement id)
 *
 * `i` and `I` are distinct namespaces: `i` is an id the client chooses and the
 * terminal honours as given, `I` is a number the client chooses that the
 * terminal maps to an id of its own, echoes back in its responses, and accepts
 * on any later command addressed by that number.
 *
 * Unicode placeholder placements (U=1) are read back off the cell buffer rather
 * than positioned at the cursor; see ./placeholders.ts for why that is the only
 * way to cover exactly the cells the client reserved.
 *
 * Deliberately out of scope:
 *   - Animation (a=f, a=a, a=c)
 *   - File, temp file and shared memory transmission (t=f, t=t, t=s). A browser
 *     cannot read the sender's filesystem; a server that wants these to work
 *     re-encodes them into direct transmissions before they reach the page.
