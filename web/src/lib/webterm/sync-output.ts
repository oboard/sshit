/**
 * Keeps a terminal repainting while an application holds DEC mode 2026,
 * synchronized output, set faster than the renderer can get a frame in.
 *
 * Mode 2026 asks the terminal not to show a half-drawn frame. xterm.js honours
 * it in two places: `RenderService.refreshRows` buffers the damaged rows when
 * the mode is set, and `RenderService._renderRows` re-checks the mode inside
 * the animation frame and declines to draw if it is set again by then. The
 * second check is the problem. An end-of-update schedules a frame, parsing
 * continues in the same task, the next begin-of-update sets the mode again
 * microseconds later, and the frame that lands up to 16 ms afterwards finds the
 * mode set and draws nothing. The debouncer has already cleared its pending
 * range, so the refresh is not deferred, it is lost.
 *
 * Under output whose synchronized updates arrive more often than once per
 * frame, every frame lands inside an update and the terminal stops painting
 * outright. Measured against a sip session replaying a btop capture at
 * 12 MiB/s: 0.0 renders per second and one distinct framebuffer over five
 * seconds, against 43.9 renders per second for the same bytes with only the
 * mode 2026 sequences removed.
 *
 * xterm carries a 1000 ms safety timeout for exactly this, but it is armed when
 * rows are buffered and cleared in the handler's `flush()`, which runs on every
 * end-of-update. The event it protects against missing is the event that
 * disarms it, so under sustained updates it never fires.
 *
 * The policy here is not to ignore the mode. Tearing every frame would be a
 * regression for the applications the mode exists to serve. It is to put a
 * ceiling on how long a repaint can be withheld: if the mode is set and nothing
 * has painted for `timeoutMs`, paint once, then let the mode go back to
 * suppressing frames. An application that finishes its updates promptly, which
 * is every correct user of the mode, never reaches the ceiling and never tears.
 *
 * Forcing a repaint runs through the code that cancels xterm's 1000 ms timeout,
 * so the watchdog also takes over the case that timeout was there for: an
 * application that stops mid-update and never sends its end-of-update. One
 * timeout after the last byte, with the mode still set, the mode is left clear
 * rather than handed back, and the terminal is live again.
